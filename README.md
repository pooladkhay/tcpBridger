## What is tcpBridger?
The idea is simple! The server part bridges any two clients (of the same kind) using their unique ids.
"chat-client" as it's name suggests, lets two parties chat over raw tcp.
"talk-client" makes it available for two clients to talk bidirectionaly over the same raw tcp.
The cool thing about it is that the server just handles the bridging. on the other words, It's client-agnostic!

Here is the first part of a series of blog posts where I will to explain this concept in detail:

This project was created only as a hobby to experiment with tcp and sound sample rates.
